# Cookie Consent Banner

This project is about creating a cookie consent banner for a Next.js application.

## Getting Started

   cd cookie-consent-banner
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```
3. **Run the App:**

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see it in action.

## How It Works

1. Open the app in your browser.

3. Choose to either accept or decline cookies.
4. Your choice will be saved, and the banner wonâ€™t appear again unless cookies are cleared.
